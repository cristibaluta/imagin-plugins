**IMAGIN** is a FREE photo gallery for your website. You can organize photos and movies, and view them as slideshow. It's easy to update the gallery with new images, just upload your photos through ftp. In this repository are the plugins used by the gallery and you can make your own.


Getting started
===============

1. Download the gallery files from http://imagin.ro
2. Get the source files of the plugins either by downloading them, either with git:

`git init`

`git pull git@github.com:ralcr/imagin-plugins.git`

Once you have the files you can compile them with Haxe and place the resulting .js files in the **IMAGIN** plugins folder
